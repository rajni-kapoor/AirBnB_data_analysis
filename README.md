# Airbnb Market Analysis (2020 vs 2023)
## Overview
This project analyzes how the U.S. short‑term rental market changed between 2020 and 2023 using Airbnb listing data. The workflow includes loading and cleaning the dataset in Python, performing exploratory data analysis, running SQL queries in PostgreSQL for deeper business insights, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to understand shifts in pricing, availability, demand, and listing growth to support data‑driven decision‑making for hosts and investors.

Columns: 18

## Key Features:

Listing details (ID, room type, price, minimum nights, availability)

Host information (host ID, host name, host listings count)

Location attributes (neighbourhood, city, latitude, longitude)

Review metrics (reviews per month, last review date, total reviews)

🛠 Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning, EDA

PostgreSQL – SQL queries for business analysis

Power BI Desktop – Dashboard creation and visualization

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

GitHub – Version control and project documentation
